This is the case for fees, but could also be done for script maximum execution budget for instance. However, not all parameters are safe to alter! Changing parameters that control the maximum size of a value (carrying native assets), or the minimum Ada value for a UTxO may render a head "unclosable"! A good rule thumb is that anything that applies strictly to transactions (fees, execution units, max tx size...) is safe to change. But anything that could be reflected in the UTxO is not.
